Socket.IO is composed of two parts:
 in the server use only npm i socket.io and import it.
 in the client use <script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.
The io object represents the Socket.IO server instance.
The connection event is triggered when a new client connects.
The socket object represents the individual client connection.
Use events to send and receive data between the server and clients.
